# Pathfinding Game
## Game Description:
This game is basically just a test of A* which is a pathfinding algorithm. The algorithm was made using a tutorial (of course) but the game itself is made by me :D
At the start you will be able to place start and goal blocks to tell the game were you want the algorithm to, well, start and end. Later on, you can place solid blocks to block the algorithm's path.

## Blocks:
- Solid (Black) - block the path of the algorithm
- Start (Blue) - where the algorithm starts
- Goal (Yellow) - the point the algorithm is trying to reach
- Vacant (White) - blocks that the algorithm did not search yet but can  
- Checked (Orange) - blocks that were checked by the algorithm
- Path (Green) - only appears in auto search, show the fastest route to the goal

## Controls:
- Click - Make a solid, start or goal block where your mouse is
- Click - Remove a solid block where your mouse is
- Space - Start algorithm
- E - Toggle auto search (off by default)
- F - Toggle labels on blocks (on by default)
- Q - Reset the game

## Notes
You are not allowed to place solid blocks as soon as the algorithm adds a orange block.
